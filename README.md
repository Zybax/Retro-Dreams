 * `git clone https://github.com/Zybax/Retro-Dreams.git`
 * `cd Retro-Dreams `
 
2. Create a `.env` file with the following content:

`REACT_APP_SC_API_KEY = "your_key_here"` (Hit me up if you need the key)

3. Go back to your terminal and run: 
 * `npm install`
 * `npm start`



## Soundcloud tracks not working?

Well basically soundcloud is not giving anymore keys for their public api, to be honest this is not even my key...

and a bunch of people are using it too, which means... there is a big chance that the key has already reached the daily request limit when you were trying to listen to something.

A shame indeed... 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
